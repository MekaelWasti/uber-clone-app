# Uber Mobile Application Clone - React Native
A clone of the mobile application for Uber. 
Created in react-native so that the application will be built natively regardless of whether you use IOS or Android.

This build was initially made with the intention of learning the react native framework for JavaScript. This means tutorials were relied upon for learning.
After building, the code would be re-analyzed in order to absorb how the framework works, and how to use it.

Then the build would be improved by implementing more features, making it more and more similar to the actual uber application while reinforcing my skills and making the project my own.

Technologies used so far include:

- React Native
- Redux toolkit
- React Native Elements
- React Native Navigation
- React Native Maps
- Google Cloud API's (Auto Complete, Directions, Matrix, Geolocation, etc)
